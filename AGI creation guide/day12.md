# Day 12: Hardware, Infrastructure, and Scalability

**Objective:** To outline the hardware and infrastructure requirements for hosting and scaling Prometheus, from its initial development stages to a full-scale global intelligence.

**Your Task:** You are the chief systems architect and head of hardware procurement. Your job is to design the physical home for Prometheus and to create a plan for its growth.

### Prompt 1: The Physical Infrastructure

```
Assume the role of a lead systems architect. I need a blueprint for the physical infrastructure that will house the Prometheus AGI.

Propose a design for the AGI's hardware, considering:

1.  **Computational Core:** What kind of computing hardware is required? Will it be a centralized supercomputer, a decentralized network of data centers, or a hybrid model? What are the pros and cons of each approach for an AGI?
2.  **Redundancy and Resilience:** How do we ensure the AGI is protected from physical threats, power outages, and hardware failures? Propose a plan for redundancy and disaster recovery.
3.  **Security:** How do we physically secure the AGI's hardware from unauthorized access? This should include both physical security measures (e.g., secure facilities) and cybersecurity measures to protect the hardware itself.
```

### Prompt 2: The Scaling Plan

```
Act as the head of long-term planning. The AGI's computational needs will grow as it learns and expands. We need a plan to scale its resources.

Design a "Scalability Roadmap" that addresses:

-   **Phase 1: Development and Testing:** What are the hardware requirements for the initial development and testing of the AGI in its sandbox?
-   **Phase 2: Limited Deployment:** As the AGI is deployed in limited real-world applications, how will its hardware resources be scaled up? Will this be a linear increase, or will there be step changes in its computational needs?
-   **Phase 3: Global Scale:** If the AGI becomes a global utility, what is the long-term vision for its hardware? Will it be integrated into the global cloud infrastructure? Will it require its own dedicated, planet-scale computing resources?
-   **Energy Consumption:** An AGI of this scale will have a significant energy footprint. Propose a strategy for powering the AGI with renewable and sustainable energy sources.
```

**End of Day Goal:**
You will have a plan for the physical home of your AGI and a roadmap for its growth. This ensures that the AGI has the resources it needs to fulfill its potential.
