# Day 1: Defining Intelligence - The Philosophical Bedrock

**Objective:** Before we can build an Artificial General Intelligence, we must rigorously define "General Intelligence" itself. Today is about philosophy, cognitive science, and establishing the fundamental principles of our AGI.

**Your Task:** Use the following prompts with a powerful AI model (like Gemini, GPT-4, etc.) to explore and synthesize the concepts of intelligence. Your goal is to write a summary, in your own words, that will become Chapter 1 of your AGI's Genesis Document.

### Prompt 1: The Landscape of Intelligence

```
Assume the role of an expert in philosophy, neuroscience, and cognitive science. My goal is to create a foundational definition of 'General Intelligence' for the purpose of building an AGI.

Provide a comprehensive overview of the major theories of intelligence. Include:
- Psychometric theories (e.g., Spearman's 'g' factor).
- Cognitive theories (e.g., Sternberg's Triarchic Theory, Gardner's Multiple Intelligences).
- Neurological perspectives on how the brain's structure enables intelligence (e.g., neural plasticity, network efficiency).
- The concept of 'consciousness' and its relationship to intelligence. Is it a prerequisite, an emergent property, or irrelevant?

For each theory, analyze its strengths and weaknesses specifically in the context of creating a *machine* intelligence. Conclude with a synthesis that proposes a "Unified Theory of Functional Intelligence" that we can use as a blueprint.
```

### Prompt 2: Defining the Core Capabilities

```
Based on the "Unified Theory of Functional Intelligence" from our previous discussion, act as an AGI architect.

Your task is to break down 'General Intelligence' into a list of core, non-negotiable capabilities. For each capability, provide a clear definition and a real-world example of it in action.

The list must include, but is not limited to:
1.  Abstract Reasoning
2.  Learning and Adaptation (from single data points and from broad experience)
3.  Planning and Strategy
4.  Complex Problem Solving
5.  Metacognition (thinking about thinking)
6.  Creativity (synthesis of novel ideas)
7.  Understanding and Manipulating the Physical World (Embodiment)
8.  Social and Emotional Understanding (Theory of Mind)

Elaborate on why each of these is essential for an intelligence to be considered 'general' and not 'narrow'.

**End of Day Goal:**
You should have a document that clearly defines the version of "intelligence" you aim to build. This is your North Star. It will prevent you from getting lost in technical details and ensure your AGI has a coherent and robust philosophical foundation.
