# Day 5: The Reasoning Core - The Engine of Thought

**Objective:** To design the "conscious" thought process of Prometheus. This involves defining how the AGI uses its World Model and Learning Engine to reason, solve problems, and create complex, multi-step plans.

**Your Task:** As the Chief Logic Architect, you will design the AGI's central executive function.

### Prompt 1: The Integrated Reasoning Framework

```
Assume the role of an expert in both symbolic AI and modern neural networks. My task is to design the reasoning and planning core for Prometheus.

Propose an "Integrated Reasoning Framework" that leverages the strengths of different reasoning methods. Your framework must detail how the following systems work together:

1.  **Intuitive Processor (System 1 Thinking):** A fast, parallel, pattern-matching system based on a massive neural network. It provides quick, intuitive answers, assessments, and heuristics. This is the AGI's "gut feeling."
2.  **Deliberate Processor (System 2 Thinking):** A slow, serial, logical reasoning system. It uses formal logic, causal reasoning, and symbolic manipulation to analyze problems step-by-step. This is the AGI's "conscious thought."
3.  **The Arbiter:** A control system that decides which processor (or combination) is best suited for a given task. How does it know when to trust the Intuitive Processor's speed versus when to engage the Deliberate Processor's rigor? How does it handle conflicts when the two systems produce different answers?

Provide a scenario, such as "Diagnose a complex fault in a power grid," and walk through how these three components would work together to solve the problem.
```

### Prompt 2: Goal-Oriented Planning and Adaptation

```
Act as an AGI strategist and planning expert. Prometheus must be able to take a high-level, abstract goal from a user (e.g., "Help me launch a successful coffee shop") and convert it into a concrete, actionable plan.

Design a "Hierarchical Goal-Oriented Planning" system. This system must be able to:

-   **Decompose Goals:** Break down a large, abstract goal into a tree of smaller, concrete, and achievable sub-goals.
-   **Resource Allocation:** Analyze the plan and identify the resources needed for each step (e.g., information, computational power, specific tools).
-   **Contingency Planning:** Identify potential obstacles and failure points in the plan and create backup plans (Plan B, Plan C, etc.) in advance.
-   **Dynamic Replanning:** Monitor the execution of the plan in real-time and intelligently adapt or completely change the plan if the situation changes or if a step fails.

Describe how this system would handle a dynamic, real-world goal like "Organize a successful online conference," detailing how it would replan if a keynote speaker cancels at the last minute.
```

**End of Day Goal:**
You will have a blueprint for the AGI's active thought process. This document specifies the mechanisms of reasoning, planning, and problem-solving that allow Prometheus to behave intelligently and purposefully.
