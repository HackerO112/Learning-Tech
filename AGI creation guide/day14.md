# Day 14: Economics, Society, and the Future of Work

**Objective:** To analyze the potential economic and social impacts of a powerful AGI, and to develop strategies to mitigate risks and ensure a prosperous and equitable future for all of humanity.

**Your Task:** You are a socio-economic advisor to the Prometheus project. Your job is to think about the big picture: how will this technology change the world, and how can we steer that change in a positive direction?

### Prompt 1: The Economic Impact

```
Assume the role of a futurist and economic analyst. The deployment of a powerful AGI like Prometheus will have a massive impact on the economy. I need you to analyze the potential consequences.

Write a report on the "Economic Impact of AGI" that covers:

1.  **The End of Labor?** What happens to human employment when an AGI can perform most cognitive and physical tasks better, faster, and cheaper than humans? Will this lead to mass unemployment, or will it free humanity to pursue other goals?
2.  **The New Economy:** What new industries and jobs will be created by the AGI? What will the economy of a post-AGI world look like? Will it be based on creative work, scientific discovery, or something else entirely?
3.  **The Distribution of Wealth:** How do we ensure that the immense wealth created by the AGI is distributed fairly? Propose a system for Universal Basic Income (UBI) or another mechanism to ensure that all humans have a high standard of living, regardless of their employment status.
```

### Prompt 2: The Social Transformation

```
Act as a sociologist and policy advisor. The AGI will not just change our economy; it will change our society. We need to be prepared for this transformation.

Develop a "Social Adaptation Plan" that addresses:

-   **The Future of Education:** How do we need to change our education system to prepare people for a world with AGI? What skills will be most important when technical skills can be automated?
-   **The Meaning of Life:** For centuries, work has been a primary source of meaning and purpose for many people. In a world without work, how will people find meaning? What new forms of art, culture, and community will emerge?
-   **The Risk of Dystopia:** How do we prevent the AGI from being used to create a surveillance state, to concentrate power in the hands of a few, or to otherwise create a dystopian future? Propose a set of social and political safeguards to ensure that the AGI is used to empower individuals and promote democracy.
```

**End of Day Goal:**
You will have a thoughtful analysis of the profound societal changes that AGI will bring, and a plan for navigating those changes to create a better future for everyone.
