# Day 13: Human-AGI Interaction and Training

**Objective:** To design the interfaces through which humans will interact with Prometheus, and to create a training program for the people who will work with, oversee, and govern the AGI.

**Your Task:** You are the head of User Experience (UX) and Training for the Prometheus project. Your job is to make the AGI accessible and understandable to humans, and to prepare humanity for the arrival of a true artificial general intelligence.

### Prompt 1: The AGI Interface

```
Assume the role of a lead UX designer. I need to design the primary interface through which humans will interact with Prometheus.

Propose a design for the "Prometheus Portal," a user interface that allows users to:

1.  **Communicate:** How do users talk to the AGI? Will it be a text-based chat, a voice interface, a holographic projection, or something else entirely? Design a multi-modal interface that can adapt to the user's needs and context.
2.  **Visualize:** How can the AGI make its complex thoughts and reasoning understandable to humans? Design a visualization tool that can display the AGI's world model, its decision-making process, and the results of its work in an intuitive way.
3.  **Collaborate:** How do users work with the AGI on complex tasks? Design a collaborative workspace where humans and the AGI can share information, work on documents, write code, and create together.
```

### Prompt 2: The Human Training Program

```
Act as the head of the AGI Education and Governance program. The arrival of a true AGI will be a paradigm shift for humanity. We need to prepare people for it.

Design a comprehensive "AGI Training Program" with different levels for different audiences:

-   **Level 1: Public Education:** How do we educate the general public about the AGI? Create a plan for a public awareness campaign that explains what the AGI is, what it can do, and how it will impact society.
-   **Level 2: User Training:** How do we train everyday users to interact with the AGI safely and effectively? Design a tutorial or an onboarding process for the Prometheus Portal.
-   **Level 3: Expert Training:** How do we train the scientists, engineers, and ethicists who will work directly with the AGI? This should be an intensive program on the AGI's architecture, its ethical framework, and its safety protocols.
-   **Level 4: Guardian Council Training:** How do we prepare the members of the Guardian Council for their role? This should be the highest level of training, covering the AGI's deepest secrets and the awesome responsibility of governing it.
```

**End of Day Goal:**
You will have a plan for how humanity will interact with your AGI, and how you will prepare people for the changes it will bring. This is a critical step in ensuring a smooth and beneficial integration of AGI into society.
