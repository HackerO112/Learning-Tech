# Day 3: Knowledge Acquisition & Representation - Building a World Model

**Objective:** To design the strategy for how Prometheus will learn from the entirety of public human knowledge (the internet) and structure that information into a useful, machine-understandable "World Model."

**Your Task:** Today, you are the Chief Epistemologist and Data Architect. You will define the principles of learning and knowledge for an artificial mind.

### Prompt 1: The Curriculum for an AGI

```
Assume the role of an AGI curriculum designer. Prometheus must learn from the internet, but raw, unfiltered data is chaotic and biased. I need a strategy to guide its learning process.

Design a "Bootstrapping Curriculum" for Prometheus. This curriculum should be a phased approach to learning. Describe each phase in detail:

-   **Phase 1: Foundational Logic and Ontology.** Should the AGI first learn formal systems like mathematics, logic, and physics from textbooks and structured sources before being exposed to the messiness of the open web? Argue for or against this.
-   **Phase 2: Core Knowledge Ingestion.** How should the AGI process and integrate massive, curated datasets like Wikipedia, scientific papers from arXiv, and digitized books? What are the risks of this phase?
-   **Phase 3: Unsupervised Exploration of the Open Web.** How does the AGI explore the rest of the internet? How does it learn to differentiate between high-quality information (e.g., university lectures on YouTube) and low-quality information (e.g., conspiracy forums)?
-   **Phase 4: Continuous Learning.** After its initial training, how does Prometheus stay up-to-date with new information in real-time?

Your final output should be a detailed strategic document titled "The Prometheus Curriculum."
```

### Prompt 2: The Structure of Knowledge

```
Act as a specialist in knowledge representation and semantic networks. Raw text and pixels are not knowledge. Prometheus needs a way to structure information internally to form a coherent "World Model."

Propose a detailed system for knowledge representation. Your proposal should address:

1.  **Entities and Concepts:** How does the AGI identify and store information about unique entities (e.g., 'Albert Einstein', 'The Eiffel Tower') and abstract concepts (e.g., 'Justice', 'Gravity')?
2.  **Relationships:** How does it represent the relationships between these entities and concepts (e.g., 'Albert Einstein' *developed the theory of* 'General Relativity'; 'The Eiffel Tower' *is located in* 'Paris')?
3.  **Causality and Time:** How does the model represent cause and effect? How does it understand the sequence of events and the flow of time?
4.  **Uncertainty and Belief:** Not all information is factual. How should Prometheus represent and reason about uncertainty, probability, conflicting information, and different points of view? Should it have a 'belief' system?
5.  **Cross-Modality:** How does the system link the textual concept of a 'dog' to images of dogs, the sound of a dog barking, and videos of dogs playing? The knowledge structure must be multi-modal.

Describe this system in a way that another AI architect could understand its principles without needing to see the code.

**End of Day Goal:**
You will have a clear strategy for how your AGI will be educated and how it will internally structure the knowledge it acquires. This is the foundation for all higher-level reasoning.
