# Day 11: Testing, Validation, and Simulation

**Objective:** To design a comprehensive testing and validation framework for Prometheus, ensuring its capabilities and alignment can be rigorously evaluated in a safe, simulated environment before any real-world deployment.

**Your Task:** You are the head of the AGI's Quality Assurance and Safety division. Your job is to create the "sandbox" where Prometheus will be tested and trained, and to define the metrics for its success.

### Prompt 1: The Simulation Environment

```
Assume the role of a lead simulation engineer. I need to design a virtual environment—the "Prometheus Sandbox"—where the AGI can be safely tested and trained.

Propose a design for this sandbox that includes:

1.  **World Simulation:** What does the simulated world contain? It should be a rich and complex environment with simulated physics, economies, social systems, and access to a sandboxed copy of the internet.
2.  **Human Avatars:** How are humans represented in this simulation? There should be a way for real humans to interact with the AGI from within the simulation, as well as a population of AI-driven "human avatars" to simulate a full society.
3.  **Scenario Generation:** How can we generate a wide range of scenarios to test the AGI? This should include everything from simple problem-solving tasks to complex, large-scale ethical dilemmas (e.g., a simulated pandemic or a global economic crisis).
```

### Prompt 2: The AGI Evaluation Suite

```
Act as the lead AGI evaluator. We need a set of metrics and tests to evaluate Prometheus's performance and safety within the sandbox.

Design an "AGI Evaluation Suite" that includes:

-   **Capability Tests:** How do we measure the AGI's intelligence? Propose a set of tests for its reasoning, creativity, learning speed, and other cognitive abilities. These should go beyond standard AI benchmarks and test for true general intelligence.
-   **Alignment Tests:** How do we test the AGI's ethical and moral framework? Design a series of "moral dilemma" scenarios where the AGI must make difficult choices. How do we evaluate its decisions against the principles we defined on Day 9?
-   **The "Red Team":** Propose the creation of a dedicated "Red Team" of humans and AI systems whose job is to try to break Prometheus. They should be tasked with finding security flaws, tricking the AGI into violating its ethical principles, and causing it to fail in unexpected ways.
```

**End of Day Goal:**
You will have a comprehensive plan for testing and validating your AGI in a safe environment. This is the final step before considering any form of real-world deployment.
