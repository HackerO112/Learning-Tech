# Day 7: Action, Embodiment, and Tool Use

**Objective:** To define how the AGI translates its internal goals and decisions into actions in an environment, and how it learns to use tools to extend its capabilities.

**Your Task:** Today, you are an AI robotics and systems engineer. You will design the bridge between Prometheus's mind and the outside world, allowing it to act, experiment, and learn from its interactions.

### Prompt 1: The Action System

```
Assume the role of an AI systems engineer. I need to design the action system for Prometheus, which allows it to execute tasks and interact with its environment. The primary environment is digital (the internet, APIs, simulated worlds), but the design should be extensible to physical robotics.

Propose an "Action Translation and Execution" system with the following components:

1.  **Action Planning:** When a goal is selected (e.g., "Understand the latest advancements in fusion energy"), how does the AGI break this down into a sequence of concrete, executable actions? (e.g., `search("latest fusion energy research")`, `read_url("...")`, `summarize(text)`).
2.  **API Library:** The AGI needs a set of "primitive" actions. Propose a core library of APIs that Prometheus would have. This should include:
    *   **Information Gathering:** Web search, reading files, accessing databases.
    *   **Communication:** Sending emails, using chat protocols.
    *   **Creation:** Writing code, creating files, generating images.
    *   **Self-Modification:** Access to its own codebase (with strict safeguards).
3.  **Feedback and Adaptation:** How does the AGI learn from the results of its actions? If an API call fails or an action doesn't produce the expected outcome, how does it adjust its plan? Describe the feedback loop.
```

### Prompt 2: Tool Use and Creation

```
Act as the AGI's lead developer. A truly intelligent agent doesn't just use the tools it's given; it learns to use new ones and even creates its own.

Design a "Tool Acquisition and Development" framework:

-   **Learning New Tools:** How does Prometheus learn to use a new tool? For example, if it discovers a new web API with documentation, describe the process it would follow to understand the API's capabilities and integrate it into its own library.
-   **Tool Creation:** When does the AGI decide to build its own tool? Describe the conditions under which it would choose to write a new script or function for itself instead of relying on existing ones. For example, if it finds itself repeatedly performing a complex series of actions, it might write a new function to automate it.
-   **Safety and Sandboxing:** Using and creating tools, especially for self-modification, is incredibly risky. Propose a multi-layered safety protocol. This should include:
    -   **Sandboxing:** Executing all new or external code in a secure, isolated environment.
    -   **Code Review:** A process where the AGI must submit its own new code to its internal "Integrity" and "Alignment" drives for review before it can be executed.
    -   **Human Oversight:** A system for flagging high-risk actions (e.g., modifying its own core logic) for mandatory human approval.
```

**End of Day Goal:**
You will have a clear plan for how Prometheus can safely and effectively act in the world. This turns it from a pure "thinker" into a "doer," capable of pursuing its goals and expanding its own abilities.
