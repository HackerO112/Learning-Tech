# Day 2: The Conceptual Architecture - Blueprint of a Mind

**Objective:** To design the high-level, conceptual architecture of the AGI. We will not think about code, but about the fundamental components of a thinking system and how they interact. This is the master blueprint for our AGI, which we'll call "Prometheus."

**Your Task:** Use these prompts to design the core systems of Prometheus. You will be acting as the chief architect, making high-level decisions that will guide the entire project.

### Prompt 1: Choosing a Cognitive Paradigm

```
Assume the role of a lead AGI architect. I need to decide on the fundamental cognitive paradigm for our AGI, "Prometheus."

Present a detailed analysis of the three leading paradigms for AGI architecture:
1.  **Symbolic (GOFAI - Good Old-Fashioned AI):** Based on logic, rules, and manipulation of symbols.
2.  **Connectionist (Neural Networks):** Based on learning patterns from data, inspired by the brain's structure.
3.  **Hybrid Models:** Systems that combine both symbolic and connectionist approaches.

For each paradigm, explain:
- Its core principles.
- Its historical successes and failures.
- Its strengths and weaknesses in achieving the 'Core Capabilities' we defined on Day 1 (e.g., how does a purely connectionist model handle abstract reasoning?).
- The primary challenges we would face in building a general intelligence with it.

Conclude with a strong recommendation for which paradigm Prometheus should be based on, and provide a compelling justification for your choice.

### Prompt 2: The Core Subsystems of Prometheus

```
Based on our decision to proceed with a [Your Chosen Paradigm from Prompt 1], act as the chief systems architect for Prometheus.

Your task is to design the primary interconnected subsystems of the AGI's mind. Create a high-level diagram (describe it in text) and a detailed description of each component.

The core subsystems must include:
1.  **The Sensory Cortex:** How the AGI ingests raw data from the entire internet (text, images, video, sound) and other sources. How does it perceive this data?
2.  **The Working Memory (Conscious Workspace):** A limited-capacity workspace where current problems, goals, and sensory data are processed. How does it decide what to pay 'attention' to?
3.  **The Long-Term Memory Store:** A vast, structured repository of knowledge, experiences, and skills. How is information encoded, stored, and retrieved? How does it differentiate between factual knowledge and episodic memory (past experiences)?
4.  **The Learning & Adaptation Engine:** The core mechanism for updating the long-term memory. How does it learn from new information, from success and failure (reinforcement), and from abstract thought (self-generation of knowledge)?
5.  **The Reasoning & Planning Core:** The central executive that uses information from memory to solve problems, set goals, and create plans.
6.  **The Action & Output Module:** The system that allows the AGI to interact with the world (e.g., generate text, speak, or in the future, control robotics).

For each subsystem, describe its function, its primary inputs and outputs, and how it interacts with the other subsystems.
```

**End of Day Goal:**
You will have a document outlining the complete, high-level conceptual model of your AGI. This is the foundational engineering document that explains *what* you are building, before you get into the *how*.
