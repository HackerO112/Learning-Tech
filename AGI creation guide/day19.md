# Day 19: The Governance of AGI: Laws and Institutions

**Objective:** To design the legal and institutional frameworks necessary to govern the development, deployment, and use of AGI on a global scale, ensuring accountability, transparency, and public trust.

**Your Task:** You are an international law expert and a policy advisor on emerging technologies. You will draft the blueprint for the global governance of AGI.

---

### Prompt 1: The Legal Framework

```
Assume the role of a legal scholar and a member of a UN commission on artificial intelligence. I need you to draft a "Model Law on Artificial General Intelligence" that can be adapted and adopted by countries around the world.

The model law should address:

1.  **Legal Personality:** Does a powerful AGI have any legal status? Is it a tool, a person, or something new? Define the legal status of AGI and the implications for liability and ownership.
2.  **Accountability and Liability:** If an AGI causes harm, who is responsible? The user, the developer, the owner, or the AGI itself? Propose a legal framework for assigning accountability and liability for AGI actions.
3.  **Data and Privacy:** How do we regulate the AGI's access to and use of data? The law should include strong protections for individual privacy and data rights.
4.  **Intellectual Property:** Who owns the creations of an AGI? The AGI, its creator, or the public domain? Propose a new framework for intellectual property in the age of AGI.
5.  **The Right to Appeal:** If a human is harmed by an AGI's decision (e.g., denied a loan, wrongly accused of a crime), what is their right to appeal? The law should ensure that there is always a human in the loop for high-stakes decisions.
```

### Prompt 2: The Institutional Framework

```
Act as a diplomat and a specialist in international relations. A global technology requires a global institution to govern it.

Propose the creation of a new international body, the "World AGI Organization" (WAGIO), and draft its charter. The charter should define:

-   **The Mandate:** What is the mission of WAGIO? It should be responsible for promoting the safe and responsible development of AGI, preventing its misuse, and ensuring that its benefits are shared by all of humanity.
-   **The Structure:** How will WAGIO be governed? It should have a General Assembly of all member states, a Security Council for responding to crises, and a permanent staff of technical experts, ethicists, and diplomats.
-   **The Powers:** What powers will WAGIO have? It should have the power to:
    -   Set international standards for AGI safety and ethics.
    -   Inspect AGI development facilities to ensure compliance with those standards.
    -   Investigate potential violations of the AGI treaty (from Day 18).
    -   Impose sanctions on countries or organizations that violate the treaty.
    -   Coordinate a global response to an AGI-related crisis.
-   **The Funding:** How will WAGIO be funded? It should have a budget funded by member states, with contributions based on their GDP and their level of AGI development.
```

**End of Day Goal:**
You will have a comprehensive plan for the global governance of AGI. This is the essential political and legal infrastructure that will allow us to manage the risks of AGI and to realize its benefits for all.
