# Day 12: Finding Structure - The Unsupervised World

**Level:** 1 (Apprentice)

**Objective:** To understand the principles and applications of unsupervised learning, focusing on the tasks of clustering and dimensionality reduction.

## Learning Without a Teacher

So far, our learning has been "supervised." We have acted as a teacher, providing the AI with labeled data (e.g., "this flower is a Setosa"). But what if you don't have the answers? What if you just have a massive amount of raw, unlabeled data?

This is the domain of **unsupervised learning**. The goal is not to predict a specific label, but to discover the inherent structure, patterns, and groupings within the data itself.

## 1. Clustering: Finding the Groups

Clustering is the task of automatically grouping similar data points together. The algorithm doesn't know the names of the groups; it just knows how to identify which data points belong together.

**The Core Idea:** Data points in the same cluster should be very similar to each other, and data points in different clusters should be very different from each other.

### K-Means Clustering

The most famous clustering algorithm is **K-Means**. Here's the intuition:

1.  **Choose K:** You decide how many clusters (`K`) you think exist in the data.
2.  **Initialize Centroids:** The algorithm randomly places `K` points, called **centroids**, in your data space.
3.  **Assign Points:** Each data point is assigned to the closest centroid.
4.  **Update Centroids:** The centroids are moved to the center of all the points that were just assigned to them.
5.  **Repeat:** Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the centroids stop moving. The final groupings are your clusters.

**Example: Clustering the Iris Dataset**

Let's see if we can rediscover the three species of Iris flowers *without* using the labels. We will ask K-Means to find 3 clusters in the data.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load the data (we ignore the labels 'y' this time)
X = load_iris().data

# Create and train the K-Means model
# We tell it to find 3 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42, n_init=10)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Get the cluster assignments for each data point
clusters = kmeans.labels_

# --- Visualization ---
# (This part is just to help us see the result)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
# Plot the data points, colored by their assigned cluster
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=clusters, cmap='viridis', marker='o')
# Plot the final centroids
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_
plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], c='red', s=250, marker='x')
plt.title("K-Means Clustering of Iris Data")
plt.xlabel("Sepal Length")
plt.ylabel("Sepal Width")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

When you run this, you will see the data points neatly separated into three colored groups. The algorithm has successfully discovered the underlying species structure without ever being told what a "species" is.

## 2. Dimensionality Reduction: Finding the Essence

Sometimes, your data has too many features (too many dimensions). This can make it hard to work with and visualize. **Dimensionality reduction** is the process of finding a lower-dimensional representation of your data that still captures its most important essence.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is the most common technique for dimensionality reduction. It works by finding the "principal components" of the data. These are new, artificial axes that capture the directions of maximum variance (spread) in the data.

Imagine your data is a flat pancake floating in 3D space. PCA would find that the most important dimensions are the two that describe the pancake's flat surface, and the third, least important dimension is its thickness. It would then allow you to project the 3D data down onto a 2D plane while losing very little information.

This is incredibly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data. The Iris dataset has 4 dimensions. We can use PCA to reduce it to 2 dimensions so we can easily plot it.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Create a PCA model to reduce the data to 2 dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2)

# Fit and transform the data
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)

# --- Visualization ---
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
# We use the real labels (y) here just to color the plot and see if PCA worked
plt.scatter(X_reduced[:, 0], X_reduced[:, 1], c=load_iris().target, cmap='viridis', marker='o')
plt.title("PCA of Iris Dataset")
plt.xlabel("Principal Component 1")
plt.ylabel("Principal Component 2")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
When you run this, you will see that even in the reduced 2D space, the three species of flowers are still clearly separated. PCA has successfully captured the essential structure of the data.

**Your Task for Today:**

1.  You will need `matplotlib`. Install it: `pip install matplotlib`.
2.  Create a file `day12.py` and run the two code examples from today.
3.  **Experiment with K-Means:** What happens if you set `n_clusters` to 2? What if you set it to 5? How does the plot change?
4.  **Think about applications:** Where could you use clustering in the real world? (e.g., grouping news articles, customer segmentation). Where could you use PCA? (e.g., compressing data, feature engineering).

This concludes the Apprentice level. You now understand the three major families of machine learning and have built your first models. You are ready to move to the Journeyman level, where we will tackle the state-of-the-art models that power AI today.
