# What is Electricity? (ELI3)

Wow! Are you ready for a secret? Look around. Your lights, the TV, mommy's phone... they all run on a secret, invisible magic called **electricity**!

But what is it? Let's pretend!

Imagine a long, long water slide at a water park. And on the slide are billions and billions of tiny, tiny water drops. So many!

Electricity is just like that! The wires in your house are like the water slides, and electricity is made of tiny, tiny little things called **electrons** that are flowing through the wires, just like the water drops!

## The Three Magic Words

To understand the magic of electricity, you just need to know three magic words.

**1. Voltage (The PUSH)**
*   Voltage is the PUSH that makes the little electrons go. It's like a big grown-up standing at the top of the water slide giving you a gentle PUSH to get you started!
*   A battery is like a little, portable pusher. A 9-volt battery gives a bigger push than a 1-volt battery.

**2. Current (The FLOW)**
*   Current is how many electrons are flowing past a spot every second. It's the FLOW.
*   Is it a little trickle of water drops, or is it a great big WHOOSH of water drops? A big whoosh is a high current!

**3. Resistance (The SQUEEZE)**
*   Resistance is anything that makes it hard for the electrons to flow. It's a SQUEEZE!
*   Imagine a part of the water slide gets really narrow. The water has to squeeze through, and it slows down. That's resistance!
*   A light bulb is a special kind of squeeze. It squeezes the electricity so much that it gets super hot and glows! It's turning the energy of the flow into light! Cool, right?

## The Big Rule: Ohm's Law

A very smart person named Mr. Ohm figured out the biggest secret of all. He said that the **PUSH** is equal to the **FLOW** times the **SQUEEZE**.

`PUSH = FLOW x SQUEEZE`

This means:
*   If you give a bigger PUSH (more voltage), you get more FLOW (more current)!
*   But if you make the SQUEEZE bigger (more resistance), you get less FLOW.

That's it! That's the secret rule that makes all our toys and lights work.

So next time you turn on a light, you can think about the big PUSH from the wall, the FLOW of tiny electrons through the wire, and the SQUEEZE in the light bulb that makes it glow so bright!

You are so smart for understanding this big secret!
