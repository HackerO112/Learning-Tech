# The Body's Secret Code! (ELI3)

Wow, hello! Did you know that your body has a secret instruction book hidden inside every tiny little piece of you? It does! It's super secret and super, super long!

This instruction book is called **DNA**. It tells your body how to build you! It decides if you have blue eyes or brown eyes, if you have curly hair or straight hair, and how tall you will be. It's the blueprint for YOU!

## The Secret Alphabet

The DNA instruction book isn't written with letters like A, B, C. It has its own special alphabet with only four letters!

*   **A**
*   **C**
*   **G**
*   **T**

That's it! The whole giant instruction book for building you is just written with these four letters, over and over again in a special pattern.

## The Shape of DNA: A Twisty Ladder

DNA is shaped like a super long, twisty ladder. It's called a **double helix**. Ooh, that's a big word!

Imagine two long, long strings. And then imagine steps connecting them, like a ladder. Now, take the top and bottom of the ladder and TWIST! That's what DNA looks like.

There's a secret rule for the steps on the ladder:
*   The letter **A** on one side always holds hands with the letter **T** on the other side.
*   The letter **C** on one side always holds hands with the letter **G** on the other side.

They are best friends! A and T are always together, and C and G are always together. Always!

## Reading the Book: The Body's Little Workers

So how does your body read this giant book? It has tiny little robot workers inside your cells!

1.  **The Copier (Transcription):** A little robot worker goes to the big DNA library and finds the right page it needs. It makes a quick copy of that page. This copy is called **RNA**. It's like taking a picture of one page of the book so you don't have to carry the whole book around!

2.  **The Builder (Translation):** Another little robot worker takes the RNA copy. It reads the letters on the copy three at a time. Each three-letter word is a secret code for one building block. These building blocks are called **amino acids**.

3.  **The Building! (Protein):** The robot reads the whole copy and sticks all the building blocks together in the right order, like LEGOs. When it's done, it has built something new called a **protein**. 

And proteins do everything! They are the tiny machines that make your muscles work, help you see, and digest your food. They do all the jobs that make you, YOU!

So, the secret code in your DNA tells the little robots how to build all the protein machines that your body needs to live.

Isn't that the most amazing secret ever? The instructions for building your whole body are written in a secret, four-letter code, hidden inside you! You are a walking, talking, super-special secret code! Wow!
