# Reading the Secret Code! (ELI3)

Hi, smarty-pants! We learned that your body has a secret instruction book, the DNA, written in a 4-letter alphabet. But it's so, so, so tiny! How do grown-ups read it?

They have a super-duper magic reading machine! It's called a **sequencer**. Let's find out how it works!

## The Big Book Problem

Your DNA instruction book is like one super, super, SUPER long word. It has billions of letters! You can't read the whole word at once. It's too long!

So, the scientists first do something that sounds silly... they shred the book!

1.  **Chop it Up!** They use tiny scissors to chop the long DNA book into millions of tiny little pieces. Snip, snip, snip!

2.  **Copy, Copy, Copy!** Then they take each tiny little piece and put it in a copy machine. They make thousands of copies of each tiny piece. Now they have big piles of all the pieces.

## The Magic Glowing Letters

This is the coolest part!

3.  **The Reading Machine:** They put all the piles of tiny DNA pieces into the sequencer machine. The machine uses special magic glue and glowing building blocks to read the code.

4.  **Glow, Little Letter, Glow!** The machine looks at the first letter of a tiny piece and finds the letter that wants to hold its hand (remember A-T and C-G?). But it uses special glowing blocks!
    *   When it adds a **T**, it makes a **red** glow!
    *   When it adds a **G**, it makes a **yellow** glow!
    *   When it adds a **C**, it makes a **blue** glow!
    *   When it adds an **A**, it makes a **green** glow!

5.  **Taking Pictures:** A super-fast camera inside the machine takes a picture of the colors. It sees "Yellow! Green! Red! Blue!" and it knows the secret code for that tiny piece was `G A T C`!

It does this for all the millions of tiny pieces at the same time! Wow!

## The Jigsaw Puzzle

Now the scientists have a new problem. They don't have the book. They have millions of tiny, jumbled-up pieces of the book. It's the biggest jigsaw puzzle in the world!

This is a job for a computer! A computer with a special robot brain inside is really, really good at puzzles.

*   **Finding Overlaps:** The computer looks at all the tiny pieces and finds pieces that have the same ending and beginning. It's like finding two puzzle pieces that fit together!
*   It might see one piece that says `A-T-T-C-G` and another that says `T-C-G-A-A`.
*   The computer says, "Hey! The end of that one matches the beginning of that one! They go together!" `A-T-T-C-G-A-A`.

It does this over, and over, and over again until it has put all the millions of puzzle pieces back together in the right order. And then... POP! It has the whole, giant instruction book for a person, or a puppy, or a flower!

So, to read the secret code of life, scientists use a magic machine that makes the letters glow, and then they use a super-smart computer to solve the biggest jigsaw puzzle ever!
