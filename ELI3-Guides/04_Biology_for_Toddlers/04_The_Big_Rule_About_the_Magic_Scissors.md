# The Big Rule About the Magic Scissors (ELI3)

Wow, you are so smart! We learned about the body's secret instruction book, DNA. And we learned about the magic scissors, CRISPR, that can fix typos in the book!

Fixing a typo that makes someone sick sounds great, right? Hooray! But grown-ups are being very, very, very careful with these magic scissors. Why?

Because there is a very, very big rule we have to think about.

## The Two Kinds of Cells

Imagine your body is a giant castle made of LEGOs.

*   **Most of your castle** is made of regular LEGOs. These are your "body cells." They make up your arms, your tummy, your brain, everything.
*   But you also have **special, sparkly LEGOs**. These are very important. They are the LEGOs you would use to build a *new* castle. These are like the body's "baby-making" cells (sperm and eggs).

## The Big, Big Difference

Here is the most important part of the whole secret.

*   If you use the magic CRISPR scissors to fix a typo in one of the **regular LEGOs** in your castle, you have only fixed it for *your* castle. When you build a new castle, it will still have the old typo. The change is just for you.

*   But... if you use the magic CRISPR scissors to change one of the **special, sparkly LEGOs**... Uh oh. Now, every new castle you build from those sparkly LEGOs will have the change. And the castles they build will have the change. And the castles *they* build will have the change... forever and ever!

Changing the sparkly LEGOs is called **germline editing**, and it is a super, duper, mega big deal. It changes the instruction book not just for you, but for your children, and their children, and their children's children, forever.

## The Big Question

Fixing a typo that makes people very sick seems like a good idea, right? But what happens next?

What if someone says, "I want to use the magic scissors to change the instruction for eye color from brown to blue?" 

Or what if they say, "I want to change the instruction for being regular height to being super tall?"

If some people can afford to give their babies these changes and others can't, will we have a world with super-tall, blue-eyed people and regular people? Would that be fair? Would that be nice?

It's a very, very tricky question. It's like having a magic wand. It's so powerful that you have to be very, very wise to use it. 

That's why grown-ups are talking a lot and thinking very hard about what the rules for using the magic scissors should be. We want to use them to help people who are sick, but we have to be careful not to make the world a less fair or less kind place.

It's a big job for big thinkers like you to think about in the future!
