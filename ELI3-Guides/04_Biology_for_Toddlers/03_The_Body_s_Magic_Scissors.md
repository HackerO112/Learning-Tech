# The Body's Magic Scissors! (ELI3)

Wowee, hello my little scientist! We know our body's secret instruction book, DNA, is written with a 4-letter code, right? And we learned how grown-ups can read the code with a special machine.

But what if there's a typo in the book? A little mistake that makes someone sick?

Well, scientists have found a new, super-duper magic tool. It's like a tiny pair of scissors and a pencil that can find a typo in the giant DNA book, cut it out, and write in the right letter! This magic tool is called **CRISPR**!

## Where Did CRISPR Come From?

This is so cool! We didn't invent CRISPR. We discovered it! It comes from tiny little creatures called bacteria. It's their secret superhero power!

Bacteria can get sick from tiny little bad guys called viruses. So, the bacteria built a secret agent to protect them.

1.  **The Secret Agent:** The secret agent is a little robot worker called **Cas9**. His job is to be a bodyguard. And he carries a tiny pair of scissors that can cut DNA.

2.  **The Most-Wanted Poster:** When a bad-guy virus comes, the bacteria takes a little snapshot of the virus's DNA. This snapshot is called a **guide RNA**. It's like a most-wanted poster!

3.  **The Hunt!** The Cas9 bodyguard holds the most-wanted poster. He floats around inside the bacteria, checking all the DNA he finds. He's looking for a match!

4.  **Snip, Snip!** If he finds DNA that matches the picture on his most-wanted poster, he knows it's a bad guy! He takes out his scissors and SNIP! He cuts the bad guy's DNA so it can't cause any trouble. Good job, Cas9!

## Using the Power for Good!

Scientists saw this and thought, "Wow! What if we could give the Cas9 bodyguard a most-wanted poster for anything we want?"

And they did! That's the big secret of CRISPR.

We can make our own guide RNA, our own most-wanted poster. We can make it match a typo in the DNA book that makes people sick.

1.  **The Mission:** We tell our Cas9 bodyguard, "Here is a picture of the typo we want to find."

2.  **The Search:** We send the bodyguard into a cell. He searches and searches the whole giant DNA instruction book until he finds the exact spot that matches his poster.

3.  **The Cut:** Then, SNIP! He cuts the DNA right where the typo is.

4.  **The Magic Fix:** The body is amazing! When it sees a cut in its DNA, it tries to fix it. And we can give it the right piece of code to use! The body sees the right piece and uses it to patch the hole. The typo is gone! The instruction book is fixed!

## The Super Big Question

This is a super, super powerful tool. It means we could fix diseases and make people healthy. Hooray!

But it also means we have to be very, very careful. If we can fix a typo that makes someone sick, should we also change the part of the book that decides how tall someone is? Or what color their eyes are?

That's a really big question that mommies and daddies and scientists are all talking about right now. It's a very important job for the future to use these magic scissors wisely.

But isn't it amazing? We are learning how to not just read the book of life, but how to write in it, too!
