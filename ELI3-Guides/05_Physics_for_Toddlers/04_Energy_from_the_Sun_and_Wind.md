# Where Does Power Come From? (ELI3)

Hey, little power-pumper! We know all our toys and lights need energy, the "go-go-go" power, to work. For a long time, grown-ups have gotten this power by burning old, yucky stuff called fossil fuels. It's like burning old, dirty logs to make a fire. It works, but it makes the air all smoky and yucky.

But there are better ways! We can get energy from things that don't run out and don't make the air dirty. Hooray! Let's learn about two of them.

## 1. Power from the Sun! (Solar Power)

The sun is a giant, hot ball of fire in the sky, right? It sends us light and warmth every single day. That light is full of energy! We can catch it!

Imagine you have a magic mat. When the sunshine hits the magic mat, the mat gets so excited that it makes electricity start flowing! It turns the sunlight right into the "go-go-go" power we can use!

These magic mats are called **solar panels**. They are usually big and dark blue or black. You can see them on the roofs of houses or in big fields.

*   **How it works:** The little bits of light, called photons, fly from the sun and BONK! They hit the solar panel. When they hit, they knock a tiny little electron loose inside the panel. And when lots of electrons start moving, that's electricity!

So, solar panels are like catching sunshine in a bucket and turning it into power for our toys! So clean!

## 2. Power from the Wind! (Wind Power)

Have you ever flown a kite? The wind pushes it up, up, up! The wind is super strong! It's just air that is moving really, really fast.

We can use that push to make energy!

Imagine a giant, giant pinwheel. A pinwheel so tall it's bigger than a house! These are called **wind turbines**.

1.  **The Push:** The wind blows on the big blades of the pinwheel.
2.  **The Spin:** The push from the wind makes the giant blades spin around and around. Whoosh! Whoosh!
3.  **The Machine:** The spinning blades are connected to a special machine called a generator. When the generator spins, it makes electricity start to flow!

So, a wind turbine is just like a pinwheel that uses the push of the wind to make the "go-go-go" power!

## The Big Problem: What About Night-Time?

Solar panels and wind turbines are amazing! But they have a little problem.

*   Solar panels only work when the sun is shining. They don't work at night!
*   Wind turbines only work when the wind is blowing. They don't work when the air is still.

But we want to watch cartoons at night! What do we do?

We have to **save the energy** for later! Grown-ups are building giant, super-big batteries. When it's sunny and windy, they fill up the batteries with all the extra power. Then, at night, they can use the power from the batteries to keep the lights on!

Solving this problem of saving energy is one of the biggest and most important jobs for the smart scientists of the future... maybe even you!
