# How Do Rockets Go to Space? (ELI3)

Hello, my little astronaut! You've seen airplanes, but what about ROCKETS? Rockets go super, super, SUPER fast! They go so fast they can go all the way to space where the stars are! Wow!

But how do they work? There's no air in space to push on like an airplane does.

## The Big Push Secret

A rocket works because of a very simple rule: **For every push, there is an equal and opposite push back.**

Let's try it!

1.  Get a balloon. Blow it up really big! Phew!
2.  Pinch the end so the air can't get out.
3.  Now... let it go!

WHOOSH! The balloon flies all over the room! Why did it do that?

The air inside the balloon pushed its way OUT of the little hole. That was the first push. The secret rule says there has to be an opposite push. So, the air pushing out the back pushed the balloon FORWARD! 

Action... and Reaction! Push... and Push Back!

A rocket is just a giant, super-powerful balloon. It's full of special rocket fuel. When you light the fuel, it turns into super hot, super fast gas. This gas shoots out the bottom of the rocket. That's the first big PUSH DOWN.

And because of the secret rule, the gas pushing down makes a big PUSH UP on the rocket, sending it all the way to space! 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... BLASTOFF!

## What is an Orbit? The Falling Trick!

So the rocket gets to space. Why doesn't it just fall back down? This is the coolest trick ever.

Imagine you are on the tallest mountain in the whole world. And you have a super-powered baseball.

1.  **You throw the ball.** It goes pretty far, but then gravity pulls it down and it lands.
2.  **You throw the ball SUPER HARD.** It goes much, much farther! It goes so far that the Earth, which is round like a ball, starts to curve away underneath it. But it still lands.
3.  **You throw the ball MEGA-ULTRA-SUPER-DUPER HARD!** The ball goes so fast that as gravity pulls it down, the Earth curves away at the exact same time! The ball is always falling, but it never, ever hits the ground! It just keeps falling *around* the Earth forever!

**THAT is an orbit!**

An astronaut in a space station isn't floating. He is falling! He and the space station and his floating sandwiches are all falling together around the Earth so fast that they never hit it.

So, to get into orbit, a rocket doesn't just have to go UP. It has to go sideways really, really, REALLY fast to play the falling trick on gravity!

Isn't that the coolest secret? You are smart enough to understand how to go to space!
