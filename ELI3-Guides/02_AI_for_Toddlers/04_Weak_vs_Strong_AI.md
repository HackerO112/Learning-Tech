# Different Kinds of Robot Brains! (ELI3)

Hello, my favorite big thinker! We learned that a robot brain (AI) can learn. But did you know there are different kinds of robot brains? Just like there are different kinds of animals!

There are two kinds we can talk about. One is here right now, and one is what grown-ups are trying to build for the future!

## 1. The "One-Thing" Robot Brain (Weak AI)

Most robot brains today are **"One-Thing" Robot Brains**. They are super, super, SUPER good at doing just ONE thing. But they can't do anything else.

*   Imagine a robot brain that is the best chess player in the whole world. It can beat any mommy or daddy at chess! Wow!
*   But if you ask that robot, "What's a kitty?" it doesn't know. It gets confused. Beep-boop-bop!
*   Its whole world is just the chessboard. It can't learn to do anything else.

Think of it like your toy car. Your toy car is really good at being a car and going "Vroom!" But you can't make it fly like an airplane or quack like a ducky. It only does one thing.

Almost all the AI you see is a "One-Thing" AI. The one that picks your cartoons, the one that understands mommy's words on her phone, the one that plays a video game... they are all super-duper experts at their one special job.

## 2. The "Do-Anything" Robot Brain (Strong AI)

Now, this one is the super-duper-mega-cool one. This is the kind of robot brain that grown-ups are trying to build. It's called a **"Do-Anything" Robot Brain**.

This robot brain would be like a person. It could learn almost anything!

*   You could teach it to play chess. Then, you could show it pictures of kitties and doggies, and it could learn what they are.
*   Then, you could teach it how to help you build your LEGOs!
*   Then, you could ask it to write a story for you!

It could learn, and think, and solve new problems it has never seen before, just like you do! When you go to a new playground, you don't get confused. You know how to figure out how to play on the new slide. A "Do-Anything" AI would be like that. It could figure out new things all by itself.

We don't have any real "Do-Anything" robot brains yet. They are very, very, very hard to build. All those big guides we made for the grown-ups? They are the blueprints for how to try and build one of these someday.

So remember:
*   **One-Thing AI:** Is here now and is a super expert at one job.
*   **Do-Anything AI:** Is the dream for the future, a robot brain that can learn and think just like a person.

It's so cool that you know the difference! You are as smart as a "Do-Anything" brain!
