# How Are Robot Brains Built? (ELI3)

Hey there, my little genius! We learned that robot brains can learn to tell the difference between a kitty and a doggy. But what does the inside of a robot brain look like? Is it all squishy like our brains?

Nope! It's built out of tiny little workers, like LEGOs! These workers are called **neurons**.

## The Tiniest Worker: The Neuron

Imagine a tiny little worker who is not very smart. All he can do is listen to his friends and then decide if he should shout or be quiet.

1.  **He Listens:** The little neuron worker has tubes coming into his ears from lots of other workers. Some of his friends are shouting, and some are quiet.

2.  **Some Friends are More Important:** He has a favorite friend! When his favorite friend shouts, he listens very carefully. When another friend who he doesn't know very well shouts, he doesn't pay as much attention.

3.  **He Decides:** After listening to all his friends, he adds up all the shouting. If it gets really, really loud and exciting, he decides to shout too! If it's quiet, he stays quiet.

That's it! That's all a single neuron does. He just listens and decides whether to get excited and shout.

## Building a Big Brain with Layers!

A single neuron worker isn't very smart. But what if we have a whole giant team of them? That's how we build a real robot brain!

We put the workers in layers, like a big layer cake.

**Layer 1: The Eye Workers**
*   These are the first workers. They look at a tiny little piece of a picture. One worker might see a pointy ear. When he sees it, he gets really excited and SHOUTS! Another worker might see a round nose, and he gets excited and SHOUTS!

**Layer 2: The Shape Workers**
*   These workers don't look at the picture. They only listen to the Eye Workers!
*   One Shape Worker might have a favorite Eye Worker who shouts for pointy ears and another favorite who shouts for whiskers. If he hears BOTH of them shouting, he thinks, "Pointy ears AND whiskers? That sounds like a kitty face!" and then HE gets excited and SHOUTS!

**Layer 3: The Boss Worker**
*   This worker is the big boss. He listens to all the Shape Workers.
*   He might hear the "kitty face" worker shouting, and a "furry body" worker shouting, and a "long tail" worker shouting.
*   He puts it all together and makes the final decision. He shouts, "IT'S A KITTY! I'M SURE OF IT!"

## Learning is Finding Your Favorite Friends!

So how does the robot brain learn? It learns by figuring out which friends are the most important!

At first, all the little workers are just listening to everyone equally. Their guesses are all silly.

But when we teach them, they start to learn. The "kitty face" worker learns that the shouts from the "pointy ear" worker and the "whisker" worker are super, super important, so he decides to listen to them more than anyone else. He makes them his favorite friends!

And that's what learning is! It's just all the tiny workers in the big layer cake figuring out which other workers they should listen to the most to get the right answer.

They work together as a team to become a super-smart, picture-recognizing robot brain! So cool!
