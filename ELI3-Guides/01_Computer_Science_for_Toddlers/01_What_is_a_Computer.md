# What is a Computer? (ELI3)

Hello! Do you have a favorite toy box? A computer is like a magic toy box with three special parts inside. Let's pretend we're looking inside!

## 1. The Thinking Brain (The CPU)

Inside the toy box, there is a super-fast little robot. This robot is the **Thinking Brain**. It's very, very good at doing exactly what you tell it to do, but it can only do one tiny thing at a time.

It can do plus-minus math really fast, and it can check if two things are the same. That's its superpower! It can go "beep-boop-bop" billions of times in one second! Wow!

## 2. The Play Area (The RAM)

The Thinking Brain needs a place to play with the toys it's using right now. This is the **Play Area**. It's a nice, clean floor where the robot can spread out all the toys it needs for the game it's playing.

The Play Area is super fast to get toys from. The Thinking Brain can just reach out and GRAB a toy instantly! So fast!

But here's the secret: when you turn the toy box off, everything in the Play Area disappears! Poof! It's only for playing *right now*.

## 3. The Big Toy Box (The Storage)

So where do all the toys go when you're done playing? They go in the **Big Toy Box**! This is where you keep all your toys safely, even when the computer is off.

The Big Toy Box is really, really big! It can hold all your games and pictures and movies. But it's also very slow. To get a toy from the Big Toy Box, the Thinking Brain has to stop what it's doing, walk over, open the lid, find the toy, and bring it back to the Play Area.

## How They Play Together!

Let's imagine you want to play a new game.

1.  You tell the computer, "I want to play my car game!"
2.  The Thinking Brain hears you! It runs over to the **Big Toy Box** (Storage) and finds the car game.
3.  It takes all the pieces of the car game and puts them in the **Play Area** (RAM).
4.  Now, the Thinking Brain can play with the cars super-fast because they are all in the Play Area! It goes "Vroom! Vroom!" and does all the game things.
5.  When you say, "Save my game!" the Thinking Brain carefully takes a picture of how the game looks and puts that picture back in the **Big Toy Box** so you can play again later.
6.  When you say, "I'm all done!" the Thinking Brain cleans up the Play Area and puts all the car game toys away. Poof!

Isn't that cool? Every computer, even your mommy's phone, is just a Thinking Brain, a Play Area, and a Big Toy Box working together!
