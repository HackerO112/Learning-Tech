# What is the Internet? (ELI3)

Wow, hello! You know how you can talk to Grandma on the phone, even if she is far, far away? The **Internet** is like a magic telephone line for all the computers in the whole wide world!

It lets computers talk to each other, even if one is in your house and the other is all the way on the other side of the world! So cool!

## The Computer's Address (IP Address)

Every house has an address, right? That's how the mailman knows where to bring letters. Every computer on the Internet has its own special address too! It's a secret code made of numbers.

This secret number address is called an **IP Address**. It's like `123.45.67.89`. That's how other computers know where to send messages!

## The Magic Phonebook (DNS)

But those number addresses are yucky and hard to remember, right? It's much easier to remember a name, like `google.com`.

So, the Internet has a giant, magic phonebook. This phonebook is called **DNS**. 

When you type `google.com` in the computer, the computer first looks in the magic phonebook. The phonebook says, "Oh, `google.com` lives at the secret number address `123.45.67.89`!" Then the computer knows where to send the message! Smart!

## Sending a Letter (Packets and TCP)

You can't send a whole giant toy through the mail at once, can you? You have to put it in a box. And if it's a really big toy, you might need a few boxes!

The Internet does the same thing. When a computer wants to send a picture to another computer, it can't send the whole thing at once.

1.  **It breaks the picture into tiny little pieces.** These pieces are called **packets**. It's like cutting the picture into a jigsaw puzzle!

2.  **It puts each piece in a little envelope.** On each envelope, it writes the address it's going to, the address it came from, and a number (like "piece 1 of 10," "piece 2 of 10").

3.  **It sends all the little envelopes!** They might even go on different roads to get there!

4.  **The other computer gets all the envelopes.** It looks at the numbers on them and puts the jigsaw puzzle back together in the right order to see the picture again! Wow!

This process of breaking things into little numbered pieces and putting them back together is called **TCP**. It makes sure your whole message gets there safely.

## The Mail Trucks (The Physical Internet)

So how do the little envelopes travel? They travel on special roads!

*   Some roads are **wires** in your house.
*   Some roads are invisible **radio waves** that fly through the air. This is called **Wi-Fi**!
*   And some roads are super-fast **light beams** that go through special glass tubes under the ocean! They are made of fiber optics and are the fastest roads of all!

So, the Internet is just a giant, worldwide system of addresses, phonebooks, and special roads for sending tiny pieces of pictures and messages between computers so they can all talk to each other! It's like a giant, magic post office for our robot friends!
