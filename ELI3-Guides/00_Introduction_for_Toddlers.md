# Hello, Big Thinker!

Wow, hello there! Are you ready to learn about some really, really big and cool things? Yay!

This is a special set of guides just for you. We're going to talk about the super smart things that grown-ups build, like computers and robot brains. But don't worry, we'll use little words and fun stories.

Think of it like this: the grown-up guides are like big, thick books with lots of long words. These guides are like picture books with fun colors!

We're going to pretend you're a super smart 3-year-old, and I'm going to tell you all the secrets of how things work.

**Our Fun Rules:**

1.  We will use lots of fun stories about toys and animals.
2.  We will ask "Why?" a lot, because that's how we learn!
3.  We will learn about HUGE ideas, but we'll take it one little step at a time.

Are you ready? Let's start our big adventure! Hooray!
